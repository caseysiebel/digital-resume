		quote: "It from bit. Otherwise put, every 'it'-every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself-derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely-even if in some contexts indirectly-from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits.",
		author: 'John Archibald Wheeler',
		blurb: 'I entered Berkeley with my major undeclared but was leaning strongly towards studying Computer Science or Economics. However, a series of courses I took on Astronomy and Cosmology drew my attention down a differnet path. A deeply seated discomfort caused by the seemingly nonesense nature of Quantum Mechanics galvanized my curiosity in the field of Physics. I was fascinated when I first heard about Wheeler\'s "it from bit" and subsiquently found myself committed to a the field of Quantum Information Science.'
